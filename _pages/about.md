Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University. My interests are in macroeconomics, particularly in short- to medium-run fluctuations.

Before coming to Northwestern, I received my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from St. John's College, University of Cambridge. I was lucky enough to be funded by [Nagase Bros., Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/9733:JP) during the four years there. 

In my free time, I like to watch (and sometimes play) rugby union. I normally play halfback. I have also played rugby league on a few occasions. I go by Hiro.
