# About
Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University. My interests are in macroeconomics, particularly in short- to medium-run fluctuations.

Before coming to Northwestern, I spent four years at St. John's College, University of Cambridge, toward my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.

In my free time, I like to watch (and sometimes play) rugby union. I normally play halfback. I have also played rugby league on a few occasions. I go by Hiro.
